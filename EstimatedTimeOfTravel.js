//JavaScript program that estimates the time needed to travel a location.

//Constant speed value
const speed = (distance, kph) => distance / kph
    console.log(`Average Speed: ${speed(5,1)} kph`)
//Output: Average Speed: 5 kph    

//Get the distance in kilometer
    const distance = prompt(`Enter the Distance In Kilometer:`)
//Output Enter the Distance In Kilometer:

//Formula for Expected Time of Arrival
const time = (distance, kph) => distance / kph

//Expected console output:
console.log(`Estimated time of travel: ${time(300,5)} hours`)
//Output: Estimated time of travel: 60 hours
